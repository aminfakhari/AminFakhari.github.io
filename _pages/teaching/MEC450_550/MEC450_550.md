## Course Description
An introduction to the design, modeling, analysis, and control of mechatronic systems (smart systems comprising mechanical, electrical, and software components). Fundamentals of the basic components needed for the design and control of mechatronic systems, including sensors, actuators, data acquisition systems, microprocessors, programmable logic controllers, and I/O systems, are covered. Hands-on experience in designing and building practical mechatronic systems is provided through integrated lab activities.
